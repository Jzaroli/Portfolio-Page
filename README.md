## Description
This app is meant to be simple and straight forward; to share information about myself to prospective companies and business partners. It's built on React, Bootstrap and Formspree to simplify the contact form routing. The various logos and images were designed using Canva.

## Usage
The design is responsive. Still, I could see a number of improvements for improving usability; especailly on mobile. That being said, the current design works for all resolutions and doesn't need overengineering.
